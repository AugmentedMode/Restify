# AI-Powered Endpoint Creation Tool

Restify now includes an advanced AI tool that can create API endpoints directly from natural language descriptions. This feature allows you to quickly create and deploy endpoints without writing any code yourself.

## How It Works

The AI assistant is equipped with a specialized tool that can:

1. Generate complete, functional endpoint code based on your description
2. Deploy the endpoint to your specified URL path
3. Organize endpoints into collections and subcollections in your workspace
4. Provide documentation and examples for using the endpoint

## Using the Endpoint Creation Tool

Simply chat with the AI assistant and describe the endpoint you need. For example:

```
Create an endpoint that validates and stores user registration data with fields for name, email, and password
```

or 

```
I need a REST API endpoint that can process image uploads and return metadata
```

The AI will use its specialized endpoint creation tool to:

1. Generate appropriate code for your endpoint
2. Format the response with full documentation
3. Add the endpoint to your collections in the sidebar
4. Create a deployed endpoint you can immediately use

## Collection Organization

The AI assistant automatically organizes your created endpoints into collections with flexible hierarchy options:

### Default Collection
If you don't specify a collection, endpoints are added to the "AI Generated Endpoints" collection:
```
Create an endpoint that returns user profile data
```

### Custom Top-Level Collection
You can specify which collection to add the endpoint to:
```
Create a user registration endpoint and add it to my User Management collection
```

### Nested Collections
You can place endpoints in nested folders by specifying a collection path:
```
Create a login endpoint and add it to the Authentication folder inside my User Management collection
```

This creates a nested structure: User Management > Authentication > (your endpoint)

You can create endpoints at any level of nesting:
```
Create a password reset endpoint in the API > User Management > Authentication > Recovery collection
```

Endpoints appear in your sidebar just like manually created ones, and you can browse, edit and test your AI-created endpoints like any other request.

## Example Outputs

When you ask the AI to create an endpoint, it will provide a beautifully formatted response like this:

```
âœ… Endpoint Created Successfully

Your new API endpoint is available at: https://api.example.com/custom/users

The endpoint has been added to the collection path: **User Management > Authentication**

### Request Example:
POST https://api.example.com/custom/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "age": 30
}

### Response Format:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "age": 30,
  "createdAt": "2023-08-15T10:30:45Z"
}

### Test with cURL:
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/custom/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "johndoe@example.com", "age": 30}'

The endpoint has been deployed and is ready to use.
```

## Advanced Usage

You can also specify additional details when requesting an endpoint:

- Authentication requirements
- Input validation rules
- Response formatting preferences 
- Error handling behavior
- Collection organization with nested paths

For example:

```
Create a secure endpoint for user login that requires email and password, validates the credentials, returns a JWT token if valid, and add it to the Authentication folder inside my API collection
```

## Technical Details

Behind the scenes, the AI:

1. Uses specialized JSON schema understanding to create properly structured endpoints
2. Implements best practices for security, validation, and error handling
3. Creates comprehensive documentation for each endpoint
4. Provides ready-to-use example code for integrating with your endpoint
5. Organizes endpoints into your workspace collections with proper nesting

## Benefits

- **Save Time**: Create endpoints in seconds without writing code
- **Consistency**: All endpoints follow best practices and standards
- **Documentation**: Automatically get documentation for each endpoint
- **Organization**: Endpoints are neatly organized in your collections with proper hierarchy
- **Testing**: Get curl commands and examples immediately

This powerful feature demonstrates how AI can streamline the development process and help you build robust APIs faster than ever before.
